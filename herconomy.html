              <h3>Savings App for <span>Women</span></h3>
              <p>
                Herconomy is an app that helps women save and earn interest,
                invest and also get discounts when they buy from affiliate
                stores. Users get up to 10% per annum on their savings. The app
                has 2 main features. The auto savings which is called Vault,
                where you automatically save frequently and have only 4
                withdrawal days yearly to encourage the habit of saving
                frequently the second main feature is called Float, which can
                also be referred to as a flexible wallet where you can withdraw
                at any time and has no breaking fee. We started the project with
                a competitive analysis, as providing uniqueness was our key
                objective here. One of the challenges I faced as the lead
                designer of the Herconomy app & web app was to make it stand out
                from other competitors while keeping the amount of data clean,
                simple, and easy to navigate on any device.
